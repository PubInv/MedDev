# MedDev: Medical Device Regulatory Approval Sunlight License

This is the home repo for MedDev, an attempt to construct a new kind of free-libre open source license aimed specifically at medical devices.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for open, transparent devices which are both suppy-chain resilient and fully tested under
normal regulatory regimes. In order to build an system of for-profit and non-profit firms that support such devices to alleviate want 
now and in the future, we believe a license that encourages a new kind of sharing is required: one that allows re-use of device designs
and test documentation by forcing publication at the time of reuse for regulatory clearance.

We are currently using a [commentable google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVDh55CssjKDlNG06Blz3yN5ZMRx6sKONC2ysyCE6x0/edit?usp=sharing) as our working document.

The diagram in the directory may give you a general idea of our approach.

## A Related Motivation

Based on some work by Sabrina Merlo of OSMS, I wrote [this essay](https://www.pubinv.org/2021/03/03/a-new-kind-of-fda-clearance-design-clearance/) proposing a new kind of FDA clearance.  This is independent of the license, but it is related as a motivational work, so I'm linking it here. It has been submitted to the [Day One Project](https://www.dayoneproject.org/).
